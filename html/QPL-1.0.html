<h2>Comments on (easy) usability</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>↑</strong>“Is OSI Approved” (source: <a href="https://spdx.org/licenses/QPL-1.0.html" title="SPDX">SPDX</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>“The QPL is not GPL-compatible, which, regardless of one's opinion about the license's DFSG-freeness, poses a major practical problem for any code licensed under the QPL that is reused elsewhere in conjunction with code under the GNU GPL. This makes the QPL alone a particularly poor choice of license for a library. Furthermore, it is not clear that the Trolltech corporation (the author of the Qt library and the QPL itself) believes the QPL to be a free software license. Trolltech's website describes how their dual-license approach is intended to be "open source-friendly" (see http://www.trolltech.com/company/model.html). If Trolltech felt that the QPL alone were friendly enough to open-source, why do they have a dual-licensing policy?” (source: <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DFSGLicenses" title="Debian Free Software Guidelines">Debian Free Software Guidelines</a>)</p></li>
