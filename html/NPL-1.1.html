Files identified with &quot;Exhibit A-Netscape Public License&quot; are governed by the Netscape Public License Version 1.1.

Additional Terms applicable to the Netscape Public License.

I. Effect. 
These additional terms described in this Netscape Public License -- Amendments shall apply to the Mozilla Communicator client code and to all Covered Code under this License.
II. &#39;&#39;Netscape&#39;s Branded Code&#39;&#39; means Covered Code that Netscape distributes and/or permits others to distribute under one or more trademark(s) which are controlled by Netscape but which are not licensed for use under this License.

III. Netscape and logo. 
This License does not grant any rights to use the trademarks &quot;Netscape&#39;&#39;, the &quot;Netscape N and horizon&#39;&#39; logo or the &quot;Netscape lighthouse&quot; logo, &quot;Netcenter&quot;, &quot;Gecko&quot;, &quot;Java&quot; or &quot;JavaScript&quot;, &quot;Smart Browsing&quot; even if such marks are included in the Original Code or Modifications.

IV. Inability to Comply Due to Contractual Obligation. 
Prior to licensing the Original Code under this License, Netscape has licensed third party code for use in Netscape&#39;s Branded Code. To the extent that Netscape is limited contractually from making such third party code available under this License, Netscape may choose to reintegrate such code into Covered Code without being required to distribute such code in Source Code form, even if such code would otherwise be considered &#39;&#39;Modifications&#39;&#39; under this License.

V. Use of Modifications and Covered Code by Initial Developer.

V.1. In General. 
The obligations of Section 3 apply to Netscape, except to the extent specified in this Amendment, Section V.2 and V.3.
V.2. Other Products. 
Netscape may include Covered Code in products other than the Netscape&#39;s Branded Code which are released by Netscape during the two (2) years following the release date of the Original Code, without such additional products becoming subject to the terms of this License, and may license such additional products on different terms from those contained in this License.

V.3. Alternative Licensing. 
Netscape may license the Source Code of Netscape&#39;s Branded Code, including Modifications incorporated therein, without such Netscape Branded Code becoming subject to the terms of this License, and may license such Netscape Branded Code on different terms from those contained in this License. 
 

VI. Litigation. 
Notwithstanding the limitations of Section 11 above, the provisions regarding litigation in Section 11(a), (b) and (c) of the License shall apply to all disputes relating to this License.
