* yet another try in rust

* Idea
A handle for a license is just a string, like
- =MIT=
  - a short_name / identifier
  - in the namespace SPDX-License-List version =3.19=
- =bsd-3-clause-no-trademark=
  - in the namespace scancode
- =The 3-Clause BSD License=
  - a full_name
- =BSD=
  - identifies a class or radical of licenses

These classify in different categories, e.g. short_names, full_names, or just some "names".
Some have namespaces.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE 
"MIT is also called 'MIT Licensen' as full_name by SPDX"

"MIT is compatible to BSD-3-Clause"
...
#+END_EXAMPLE
