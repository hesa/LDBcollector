<p>This is a free software, copyleft license.  Its terms effectively

<p>Please note that the GNU AGPL is not compatible with GPLv2.  It is
also technically not compatible with GPLv3 in a strict sense: you
cannot take code released under the GNU AGPL and convey or modify it
however you like under the terms of GPLv3, or vice versa.  However,
you are allowed to combine separate modules or source files released
under both of those licenses in a single project, which will provide
many programmers with all the permission they need to make the
programs they want.  See section 13 of both licenses for

<p>This license is sometimes referred to as the 3-clause BSD license.</p>

<p>The modified BSD license is not bad, as lax permissive licenses go,
though the Apache 2.0 license is preferable.  However, it is risky to
recommend use of &ldquo;the BSD license&rdquo;, even for special cases
such as small programs, because confusion could easily occur and lead
to use of the flawed <a href="#OriginalBSD"><em>original</em> BSD
license</a>.  To avoid this risk, you can suggest the X11 license
instead.  The X11 license and the modified BSD license are

&ldquo;protection&rdquo;</a>; this decision
was unfortunate, because reading the license tends to spread the
presuppositions of those terms.  However, this does not cause any
particular problem for the programs released under the CeCILL.</p>

<p>Section 9.4 of the CeCILL commits the program's developers to certain
forms of cooperation with the users, if someone attacks the program
with a patent.  You might look at that as a problem for the developer;
however, if you are sure you would want to cooperate with the users in
those ways anyway, then it isn't a problem for you.</p></dd>

<p>In the United States, these licenses are supposed to be interpreted
based on what the author seems to intend.  So they probably mean what
they appear to mean.  That would make them non-copyleft free software
licenses and compatible with the GNU GPL.  However, an unlucky choice
of wording could give it a different meaning.</p>

<p>However, many other countries have a more rigid approach to
copyright licenses.  There is no telling what courts in those
countries might decide an informal statement means.  Courts might
even decide that it is not a license at all.</p>

<p>ISC has told us they do not share the University of Washington's interpretation, and we have every reason to believe them. ISC also updated the license to read &ldquo;Permission to use, copy, modify, <strong>and/or</strong> distribute this software&hellip;&rdquo; While the inclusion of &ldquo;and/or&rdquo; doesn't completely solve the issue, there's no reason to avoid software released under this license. However, to help make sure this language cannot cause any trouble in the future, we encourage developers to choose a different license for their own works.

<p>This is a free software license.  Section 3.3 provides indirect
compatibility between this license and the GNU GPL version 2.0, the
GNU LGPL version 2.1, the GNU AGPL version 3, and all later versions
of those licenses.  When you receive work under MPL 2.0,
you may make a &ldquo;Larger Work&rdquo; that combines that work with
work under those GNU licenses.  When you do, section 3.3 gives
you permission to distribute the MPL-covered work under the terms of
the same GNU licenses, with one condition: you must make sure that the
files that were originally under the MPL are still available under the
MPL's terms as well.  In other words, when you make a combination this
way, the files that were originally under the MPL will be dual
licensed under the MPL and the GNU license(s).  The end result is that
the Larger Work, as a whole, will be covered under the GNU license(s).
People who receive that combination from you will have the option to
use any files that were originally covered by the MPL under that
license's terms, or distribute the Larger Work in whole or in part
under the GNU licenses' terms with no further restrictions.</p>

<p>It's important to understand that the condition to distribute files
under the MPL's terms only applies to the party that first creates and
distributes the Larger Work.  If it applied to their recipients as well, it
would be a further restriction and incompatible with the GPL and AGPL.
That said, when you make contributions to an existing project, we usually
<a href="/licenses/license-recommendations.html#contributing">recommend that you keep your changes under the same license</a>,
even when you're not required to do so.  If you receive a work under a GNU
license where some files are also under the MPL, you should only remove the
MPL from those files when there's a strong reason to justify it.</p>

<p>Check the license notices on the MPL-covered software before you make
a Larger Work this way.  Parties who release original work under
MPL 2.0 may choose to opt out of this compatibility by
including a sentence in the license notices that says that the work is
&ldquo;Incompatible With Secondary Licenses.&rdquo; Any software that
includes this notice is <strong>not</strong> compatible with the GPL
or AGPL.</p>

<p>Software under previous versions of the MPL can be upgraded to version
2.0, but any software that isn't already available under one of the
listed GNU licenses <strong>must</strong> be marked as Incompatible With Secondary
Licenses.  This means that software that's only available under
previous versions of the MPL is still incompatible with the GPL and AGPL.</p>

<p>This is a license that Unicode, Inc. has applied to the Unicode
Character Database&mdash;various data files that developers can use to
help implement the Unicode standard in their own programs.  It is a
lax permissive license, compatible with all versions of the GPL.</p>

<p>If you want to use files covered by this License Agreement in your
own software, that shouldn't be any problem, but we recommend that
you also include a full copy of its text.  Some of the files contain
alternative license terms which are nonfree, or no licensing
information at all, so including a copy of the License Agreement
will help avoid confusion when others want to distribute your
software.  Of course, you'll also need to follow the conditions in
this License Agreement for distributing the files, but those are
very straightforward.</p>

<p>Please take care to ensure that the files you are using are covered
by this License Agreement.  Other files published by Unicode,
Inc. are covered by the Unicode Terms of Use, a different, nonfree
license that appears on the same page but covers different files.  A
short explanation at the top of this License Agreement details
which files it covers.</p>

<p>Please do not use this License Agreement for your own software.  If
you want to use a lax permissive license for your project, please use
the <a href="#Expat">Expat license</a> for a small program and the
Apache 2.0 license for a substantial program.  These are far more
common, and widely recognized in the free software community.</p></dd>

<p>This is a lax, permissive non-copyleft free software license, compatible

<p>The Unlicense is a public domain dedication.  A work released

Both public domain works and the lax license provided by the
Unlicense are compatible with the GNU GPL.</p>

<p>If you want to release your work to the public domain, we recommend
you use <a href="#CC0">CC0</a>.  CC0 also provides a public domain
dedication with a fallback license, and is more thorough and
mature than the Unlicense.</p></dd>
