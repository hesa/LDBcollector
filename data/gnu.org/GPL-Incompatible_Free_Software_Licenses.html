<dd>
<p>This license is an incomplete statement of the distribution terms
for LaTeX.  As far as it goes, it is a free software license, but
incompatible with the <a
href="/licenses/gpl.html">GPL</a> because it has
many requirements that are not in the GPL.</p>

<p>This license contains complex and annoying restrictions on how to
publish a modified version, including one requirement that falls just
barely on the good side of the line of what is acceptable: that any
modified file must have a new name.</p>

<p>The reason this requirement is acceptable for LaTeX is that TeX has
a facility to allow you to map file names, to specify &ldquo;use file
bar when file foo is requested&rdquo;.  With this facility, the
requirement is merely annoying; without the facility, the same
requirement would be a serious obstacle, and we would have to conclude
it makes the program nonfree.</p>

<p>This condition may cause trouble with some major modifications.
For example, if you wanted to port an LPPL-covered work to another
system that lacked a similar remapping facility, but still required
users to request this file by name, you would need to implement a
remapping facility too to keep this software free.  That would be a
nuisance, but the fact that a license would make code nonfree if
transplanted into a very different context does not make it nonfree in
the original context.</p>

<p>The LPPL says that some files, in certain versions of LaTeX, may have
additional restrictions, which could render them nonfree.  For this
reason, it may take some careful checking to produce a version of
LaTeX that is free software.</p>

<p>The LPPL makes the controversial claim that simply having files on a
machine where a few other people could log in and access them in
itself constitutes distribution.  We believe courts would not uphold
this claim, but it is not good for people to start making the claim.</p>

<p>Please do not use this license for any other project.</p>

<p>Note: These comments are for version 1.2 (3 Sep 1999) of the LPPL.</p></dd>

<dd>
<p>This license is used by most of PHP4.  It is a non-copyleft free
software license.  It is incompatible with the GNU GPL because it
includes strong restrictions on the use of &ldquo;PHP&rdquo; in the
name of derived products.</p>

<p>We recommend that you not use this license for anything except PHP
add-ons.</p></dd>

<p>This is a free software license but is incompatible with the GNU GPL.
The primary incompatibility is that this Python license is governed by the
laws of the State of Virginia, in the USA, and the GPL does not permit
this.</p></dd>


<dt><a id="QPL" href="http://directory.fsf.org/wiki/License:QPLv1.0">
    Q Public License (QPL), Version 1.0</a>
    <span class="anchor-reference-id">(<a href="#QPL">#QPL</a>)</span></dt>
<dd>
<p>This is a non-copyleft free software license which is incompatible with
the GNU GPL.  It also causes major practical inconvenience, because modified
sources can only be distributed as patches.</p>

<p>We recommend that you avoid using the QPL for anything that you write,
and use QPL-covered software packages only when absolutely necessary.
However, this avoidance no longer applies to Qt itself, since Qt is
now also released under the GNU GPL.</p>

<p>Since the QPL is incompatible with the GNU GPL, you cannot take a
GPL-covered program and QPL-covered program and link them together, no
matter how.</p>

<p>However, if you have written a program that uses QPL-covered library
(called FOO), and you want to release your program under the GNU GPL,
you can easily do that.  You can resolve the conflict <em>for your
program</em> by adding a notice like this to it:</p>
<pre>
  As a special exception, you have permission to link this program
  with the FOO library and distribute executables, as long as you
  follow the requirements of the GNU GPL in regard to all of the
  software in the executable aside from FOO.
</pre>

<p>You can do this, legally, if you are the copyright holder for the
program.  Add it in the source files, after the notice that says
the program is covered by the GNU GPL.</p></dd>

<p>This is a free software license.  It has a copyleft similar to the
one found in the Mozilla Public License.  It also has a choice of law
