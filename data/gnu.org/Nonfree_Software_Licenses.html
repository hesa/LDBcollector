<dd>
<p>If source code does not carry a license to give users the four
essential freedoms, then unless it has been explicitly and validly
placed in the public domain, it is not free software.</p>

<p>Some developers think that code with no license is
automatically <a href="#PublicDomain">in the public domain</a>.  That
is not true under today's copyright law; rather, all copyrightable
works are copyrighted by default.  This includes programs.  Absent a
license to grant users freedom, they don't have any.  In some
countries, users that download code with no license may infringe
copyright merely by compiling it or running it.</p>

<p>In order for a program to be free, its copyright holders must
explicitly grant users the <a href="/philosophy/free-sw.html"> four
essential freedoms</a>.  The document with which they do so is called
a <em>free software license</em>.  This is what free software
licenses are for.</p>

<p>Some countries allow authors to put code in the public domain, but
that requires explicit action.  If you wish to do that, the method we
recommend is to use <a href="#CC0">CC0</a>, which also works in other
countries by putting on a license that is more or less equivalent to
public domain.  However, in most cases it
is <a href="/licenses/license-recommendations.html"> better to
copyleft your code</a> to assure that freedom reaches all users of the
code.</p>

<p>Code written by employees of the US government is a special
exception, since US copyright law explicitly puts that in the public
domain; but this does not apply to works that the US pays a company to
write.  It also does not apply to other countries, many of which do
allow the state to have a copyright on government writings.</p>

<p>The AT&amp;T Public License is a nonfree license.  It has several
serious problems:</p>

<ol>
<li>The patent license is voided by any modification, no matter how
small, of the pertinent code.</li>
<li>You must demand a written agreement when you distribute the
sources or patches.</li>
<li>It requires notifying AT&amp;T if you distribute a patch.</li>
<li>Your license can be terminated through no fault of yours, under
section 8/3.</li>
<li>It makes compliance with export control laws a condition
of the license.</li>
<li>Some versions of the license require you to provide support.</li>
<li>Some versions of the license say you cannot sell a copy of the
software for more than the expense of distribution.</li>
</ol>

<p>The license has two other obnoxious features:</p>
<ol>
<li>It has a very broad reverse license to AT&amp;T, which goes far beyond
the use of your code, even your code modified.</li>
<li>It asserts one needs a license from AT&amp;T to make a link to their
web site.  This is not an immediate practical problem, since the
license says it gives permission to make such a link.  (Anyway, people
shouldn't make links to sites about nonfree software.)  But such
a claim should not be made or propagated.</li>
