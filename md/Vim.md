    VIM LICENSE

    I)  There are no restrictions on distributing unmodified copies of Vim except
        that they must include this license text.  You can also distribute
        unmodified parts of Vim, likewise unrestricted except that they must
        include this license text.  You are also allowed to include executables
        that you made from the unmodified Vim sources, plus your own usage
        examples and Vim scripts.

    II) It is allowed to distribute a modified (or extended) version of Vim,
        including executables and/or source code, when the following four
        conditions are met:
        1) This license text must be included unmodified.
        2) The modified Vim must be distributed in one of the following five ways:
           a) If you make changes to Vim yourself, you must clearly describe in
    	  the distribution how to contact you.  When the maintainer asks you
    	  (in any way) for a copy of the modified Vim you distributed, you
    	  must make your changes, including source code, available to the
    	  maintainer without fee.  The maintainer reserves the right to
    	  include your changes in the official version of Vim.  What the
    	  maintainer will do with your changes and under what license they
    	  will be distributed is negotiable.  If there has been no negotiation
    	  then this license, or a later version, also applies to your changes.
    	The current maintainer is Bram Moolenaar <Bram@vim.org>. If this 
    	  changes it will be announced in appropriate places (most likely
    	  vim.sf.net, www.vim.org and/or comp.editors).  When it is completely
    	  impossible to contact the maintainer, the obligation to send him
    	  your changes ceases.  Once the maintainer has confirmed that he has
    	  received your changes they will not have to be sent again.
           b) If you have received a modified Vim that was distributed as
    	  mentioned under a) you are allowed to further distribute it
    	  unmodified, as mentioned at I).  If you make additional changes the
    	  text under a) applies to those changes.
           c) Provide all the changes, including source code, with every copy of
    	  the modified Vim you distribute.  This may be done in the form of a
    	  context diff.  You can choose what license to use for new code you
    	  add.  The changes and their license must not restrict others from
    	  making their own changes to the official version of Vim.
           d) When you have a modified Vim which includes changes as mentioned
    	  under c), you can distribute it without the source code for the
    	  changes if the following three conditions are met:
    	  - The license that applies to the changes permits you to distribute
    	    the changes to the Vim maintainer without fee or restriction, and
    	    permits the Vim maintainer to include the changes in the official
    	    version of Vim without fee or restriction.
    	  - You keep the changes for at least three years after last
    	    distributing the corresponding modified Vim.  When the maintainer
    	    or someone who you distributed the modified Vim to asks you (in
    	    any way) for the changes within this period, you must make them
    	    available to him.
    	  - You clearly describe in the distribution how to contact you.  This
    	    contact information must remain valid for at least three years
    	    after last distributing the corresponding modified Vim, or as long
    	    as possible.
           e) When the GNU General Public License (GPL) applies to the changes,
    	  you can distribute the modified Vim under the GNU GPL version 2 or
    	  any later version.
        3) A message must be added, at least in the output of the ":version"
           command and in the intro screen, such that the user of the modified Vim
           is able to see that it was modified.  When distributing as mentioned
           under 2)e) adding the message is only required for as far as this does
           not conflict with the license used for the changes.
        4) The contact information as required under 2)a) and 2)d) must not be
           removed or changed, except that the person himself can make
           corrections.

    III) If you distribute a modified version of Vim, you are encouraged to use
         the Vim license for your changes and make them available to the
         maintainer, including the source code.  The preferred way to do this is
         by e-mail or by uploading the files to a server and e-mailing the URL.
         If the number of changes is small (e.g., a modified Makefile) e-mailing a
         context diff will do.  The e-mail address to be used is
    <maintainer@vim.org> 

    IV)  It is not allowed to remove this license from the distribution of the Vim
         sources, parts of it or from a modified version.  You may use this
         license for previous Vim releases instead of the license that they came
         with, at your option.


    Note:

    - If you are happy with Vim, please express that by reading the rest of this
      file and consider helping needy children in Uganda.

    - If you want to support further Vim development consider becoming a
      |sponsor|.  The money goes to Uganda anyway.

    - According to Richard Stallman the Vim license is GNU GPL compatible.
      A few minor changes have been made since he checked it, but that should not
      make a difference.

    - If you link Vim with a library that goes under the GNU GPL, this limits
      further distribution to the GNU GPL.  Also when you didn't actually change
      anything in Vim.

    - Once a change is included that goes under the GNU GPL, this forces all
      further changes to also be made under the GNU GPL or a compatible license.

    - If you distribute a modified version of Vim, you can include your name and
      contact information with the "--with-modified-by" configure argument or the
      MODIFIED_BY define.

You can also distribute\n    unmodified parts of Vim, likewise unrestricted except that they must\n    include this license text.  You are also allowed to include executables\n    that you made from the unmodified Vim sources, plus your own usage\n    examples and Vim scripts.\n\nII) It is allowed to distribute a modified (or extended) version of Vim,\n    including executables and/or source code, when the following four\n    conditions are met:\n    1) This license text must be included unmodified.\n    2) The modified Vim must be distributed in one of the following five ways:\n       a) If you make changes to Vim yourself, you must clearly describe in\n\t  the distribution how to contact you.  When the maintainer asks you\n\t  (in any way) for a copy of the modified Vim you distributed, you\n\t  must make your changes, including source code, available to the\n\t  maintainer without fee.  The maintainer reserves the right to\n\t  include your changes in the official version of Vim.  What the\n\t  maintainer will do with your changes and under what license they\n\t  will be distributed is negotiable.  If there has been no negotiation\n\t  then this license, or a later version, also applies to your changes.\n\tThe current maintainer is Bram Moolenaar <Bram@vim.org>. If this \n\t  changes it will be announced in appropriate places (most likely\n\t  vim.sf.net, www.vim.org and/or comp.editors).  When it is completely\n\t  impossible to contact the maintainer, the obligation to send him\n\t  your changes ceases.  Once the maintainer has confirmed that he has\n\t  received your changes they will not have to be sent again.\n       b) If you have received a modified Vim that was distributed as\n\t  mentioned under a) you are allowed to further distribute it\n\t  unmodified, as mentioned at I).  If you make additional changes the\n\t  text under a) applies to those changes.\n       c) Provide all the changes, including source code, with every copy of\n\t  the modified Vim you distribute.  This may be done in the form of a\n\t  context diff.  You can choose what license to use for new code you\n\t  add.  The changes and their license must not restrict others from\n\t  making their own changes to the official version of Vim.\n       d) When you have a modified Vim which includes changes as mentioned\n\t  under c), you can distribute it without the source code for the\n\t  changes if the following three conditions are met:\n\t  - The license that applies to the changes permits you to distribute\n\t    the changes to the Vim maintainer without fee or restriction, and\n\t    permits the Vim maintainer to include the changes in the official\n\t    version of Vim without fee or restriction.\n\t  - You keep the changes for at least three years after last\n\t    distributing the corresponding modified Vim.  When the maintainer\n\t    or someone who you distributed the modified Vim to asks you (in\n\t    any way) for the changes within this period, you must make them\n\t    available to him.\n\t  - You clearly describe in the distribution how to contact you.  This\n\t    contact information must remain valid for at least three years\n\t    after last distributing the corresponding modified Vim, or as long\n\t    as possible.\n       e) When the GNU General Public License (GPL) applies to the changes,\n\t  you can distribute the modified Vim under the GNU GPL version 2 or\n\t  any later version.\n    3) A message must be added, at least in the output of the \":version\"\n       command and in the intro screen, such that the user of the modified Vim\n       is able to see that it was modified.  When distributing as mentioned\n       under 2)e) adding the message is only required for as far as this does\n       not conflict with the license used for the changes.\n    4) The contact information as required under 2)a) and 2)d) must not be\n       removed or changed, except that the person himself can make\n       corrections.\n\nIII) If you distribute a modified version of Vim, you are encouraged to use\n     the Vim license for your changes and make them available to the\n     maintainer, including the source code.  The preferred way to do this is\n     by e-mail or by uploading the files to a server and e-mailing the URL.\n     If the number of changes is small (e.g., a modified Makefile) e-mailing a\n     context diff will do.
