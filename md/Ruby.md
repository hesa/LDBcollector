General Comments

-   “This version of the Ruby license is the latest found in the dual
    license COPYING dated from 2010-09-15 Per SPDX.org, Ruby is
    disjunctively licensed project that allows the choice of this
    license and another. The other license choice has changed over time
    (from GPL originally, to BSD-2-Clause currently), so one needs to be
    aware of that change. The Ruby License itself is un-versioned, but
    has varied a bit over the years, the last substantive variation
    being in 2002. ” (source:
