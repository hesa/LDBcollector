    The FreeType Project LICENSE
    ----------------------------
    2006-Jan-27

    Copyright 1996-2002, 2006 by
    David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg

    Introduction
    ============

      The FreeType  Project is distributed in  several archive packages;
      some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine,
      various tools and  contributions which rely on, or  relate to, the
      FreeType Project.

      This  license applies  to all  files found  in such  packages, and
      which do not  fall under their own explicit  license.  The license
      affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs,
      documentation and makefiles, at the very least.

      This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG
      (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion
      and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products
      alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:

        o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be
          interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)

        o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or
          full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)

        o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use
          it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge
          somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the
          FreeType code. (`credits')

      We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this
      software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products.
      We  disclaim  all warranties  covering  The  FreeType Project  and
      assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.

      Finally,  many  people  asked  us  for  a  preferred  form  for  a
      credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license.  We thus
      encourage you to use the following text:

       """  
        Portions of this software are copyright © <year> The FreeType
        Project (www.freetype.org).  All rights reserved.
       """

      Please replace <year> with the value from the FreeType version you
      actually use.


    Legal Terms
    ===========

    0. Definitions
    --------------

      Throughout this license,  the terms `package', `FreeType Project',
      and  `FreeType  archive' refer  to  the  set  of files  originally
      distributed  by the  authors  (David Turner,  Robert Wilhelm,  and
      Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha,
      beta or final release.

      `You' refers to  the licensee, or person using  the project, where
      `using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source
      code as  well as linking it  to form a  `program' or `executable'.
      This  program is  referred to  as  `a program  using the  FreeType
      engine'.

      This  license applies  to all  files distributed  in  the original
      FreeType  Project,   including  all  source   code,  binaries  and
      documentation,  unless  otherwise  stated   in  the  file  in  its
      original, unmodified form as  distributed in the original archive.
      If you are  unsure whether or not a particular  file is covered by
      this license, you must contact us to verify this.

      The FreeType  Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000  by David Turner,
      Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg.  All rights reserved except as
      specified below.

    1. No Warranty
    --------------

      THE FREETYPE PROJECT  IS PROVIDED `AS IS' WITHOUT  WARRANTY OF ANY
      KIND, EITHER  EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,  INCLUDING, BUT NOT  LIMITED TO,
      WARRANTIES  OF  MERCHANTABILITY   AND  FITNESS  FOR  A  PARTICULAR
      PURPOSE.  IN NO EVENT WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS
      BE LIABLE  FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED  BY THE USE OR  THE INABILITY TO
      USE, OF THE FREETYPE PROJECT.

    2. Redistribution
    -----------------

      This  license  grants  a  worldwide, royalty-free,  perpetual  and
      irrevocable right  and license to use,  execute, perform, compile,
      display,  copy,   create  derivative  works   of,  distribute  and
      sublicense the  FreeType Project (in  both source and  object code
      forms)  and  derivative works  thereof  for  any  purpose; and  to
      authorize others  to exercise  some or all  of the  rights granted
      herein, subject to the following conditions:

        o Redistribution of  source code  must retain this  license file
          (`FTL.TXT') unaltered; any  additions, deletions or changes to
          the original  files must be clearly  indicated in accompanying
          documentation.   The  copyright   notices  of  the  unaltered,
          original  files must  be  preserved in  all  copies of  source
          files.

        o Redistribution in binary form must provide a  disclaimer  that
          states  that  the software is based in part of the work of the
          FreeType Team,  in  the  distribution  documentation.  We also
          encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page  in  your
          documentation, though this isn't mandatory.

      These conditions  apply to any  software derived from or  based on
      the FreeType Project,  not just the unmodified files.   If you use
      our work, you  must acknowledge us.  However, no  fee need be paid
      to us.

    3. Advertising
    --------------

      Neither the  FreeType authors and  contributors nor you  shall use
      the name of the  other for commercial, advertising, or promotional
      purposes without specific prior written permission.

      We suggest,  but do not require, that  you use one or  more of the
      following phrases to refer  to this software in your documentation
      or advertising  materials: `FreeType Project',  `FreeType Engine',
      `FreeType library', or `FreeType Distribution'.

      As  you have  not signed  this license,  you are  not  required to
      accept  it.   However,  as  the FreeType  Project  is  copyrighted
      material, only  this license, or  another one contracted  with the
      authors, grants you  the right to use, distribute,  and modify it.
      Therefore,  by  using,  distributing,  or modifying  the  FreeType
      Project, you indicate that you understand and accept all the terms
      of this license.

    4. Contacts
    -----------

      There are two mailing lists related to FreeType:

        o freetype@nongnu.org

          Discusses general use and applications of FreeType, as well as
          future and  wanted additions to the  library and distribution.
          If  you are looking  for support,  start in  this list  if you
          haven't found anything to help you in the documentation.

        o freetype-devel@nongnu.org

          Discusses bugs,  as well  as engine internals,  design issues,
          specific licenses, porting, etc.

The license\r\n  affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs,\r\n  documentation and makefiles, at the very least.\r\n\r\n  This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG\r\n  (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion\r\n  and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products\r\n  alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:\r\n\r\n    o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be\r\n      interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)\r\n\r\n    o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or\r\n      full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)\r\n\r\n    o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use\r\n      it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge\r\n      somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the\r\n      FreeType code. (`credits')\r\n\r\n  We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this\r\n  software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products.\r\n  We  disclaim  all warranties  covering  The  FreeType Project  and\r\n  assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Finally,  many  people  asked  us  for  a  preferred  form  for  a\r\n  credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license.  We thus\r\n  encourage you to use the following text:\r\n\r\n   \"\"\"\r\n    Portions of this software are copyright ï½© <year> The FreeType\r\n    Project (www.freetype.org).

Definitions\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n  Throughout this license,  the terms `package', `FreeType Project',\r\n  and  `FreeType  archive' refer  to  the  set  of files  originally\r\n  distributed  by the  authors  (David Turner,  Robert Wilhelm,  and\r\n  Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha,\r\n  beta or final release.\r\n\r\n  `You' refers to  the licensee, or person using  the project, where\r\n  `using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source\r\n  code as  well as linking it  to form a  `program' or `executable'.\r\n  This  program is  referred to  as  `a program  using the  FreeType\r\n  engine'.\r\n\r\n  This  license applies  to all  files distributed  in  the original\r\n  FreeType  Project,   including  all  source   code,  binaries  and\r\n  documentation,  unless  otherwise  stated   in  the  file  in  its\r\n  original, unmodified form as  distributed in the original archive.\r\n  If you are  unsure whether or not a particular  file is covered by\r\n  this license, you must contact us to verify this.\r\n\r\n  The FreeType  Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000  by David Turner,\r\n  Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg.

The  copyright   notices  of  the  unaltered,\r\n      original  files must  be  preserved in  all  copies of  source\r\n      files.\r\n\r\n    o Redistribution in binary form must provide a  disclaimer  that\r\n      states  that  the software is based in part of the work of the\r\n      FreeType Team,  in  the  distribution  documentation.  We also\r\n      encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page  in  your\r\n      documentation, though this isn't mandatory.\r\n\r\n  These conditions  apply to any  software derived from or  based on\r\n  the FreeType Project,  not just the unmodified files.   If you use\r\n  our work, you  must acknowledge us.  However, no  fee need be paid\r\n  to us.\r\n\r\n3. Advertising\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n  Neither the  FreeType authors and  contributors nor you  shall use\r\n  the name of the  other for commercial, advertising, or promotional\r\n  purposes without specific prior written permission.\r\n\r\n  We suggest,  but do not require, that  you use one or  more of the\r\n  following phrases to refer  to this software in your documentation\r\n  or advertising  materials: `FreeType Project',  `FreeType Engine',\r\n  `FreeType library', or `FreeType Distribution'.\r\n\r\n  As  you have  not signed  this license,  you are  not  required to\r\n  accept  it.   However,  as  the FreeType  Project  is  copyrighted\r\n  material, only  this license, or  another one contracted  with the\r\n  authors, grants you  the right to use, distribute,  and modify it.\r\n  Therefore,  by  using,  distributing,  or modifying  the  FreeType\r\n  Project, you indicate that you understand and accept all the terms\r\n  of this license.\r\n\r\n4. Contacts\r\n-----------\r\n\r\n  There are two mailing lists related to FreeType:\r\n\r\n    o freetype@nongnu.org\r\n\r\n      Discusses general use and applications of FreeType, as well as\r\n      future and  wanted additions to the  library and distribution.\r\n      If  you are looking  for support,  start in  this list  if you\r\n      haven't found anything to help you in the documentation.\r\n\r\n    o freetype-devel@nongnu.org\r\n\r\n      Discusses bugs,  as well  as engine internals,  design issues,\r\n      specific licenses, porting, etc.\r\n\r\n  Our home page can be found at\r\n\r\n    http://www.freetype.org\r\n\r\n\r\n--- end of FTL.TXT ---",

The license\r\n  affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs,\r\n  documentation and makefiles, at the very least.\r\n\r\n  This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG\r\n  (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion\r\n  and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products\r\n  alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:\r\n\r\n    o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be\r\n      interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)\r\n\r\n    o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or\r\n      full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)\r\n\r\n    o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use\r\n      it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge\r\n      somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the\r\n      FreeType code. (`credits')\r\n\r\n  We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this\r\n  software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products.\r\n  We  disclaim  all warranties  covering  The  FreeType Project  and\r\n  assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Finally,  many  people  asked  us  for  a  preferred  form  for  a\r\n  credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license.  We thus\r\n  encourage you to use the following text:\r\n\r\n   \"\"\"\r\n    Portions of this software are copyright ï½© <year> The FreeType\r\n    Project (www.freetype.org).

Advertising\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n  Neither the  FreeType authors and  contributors nor you  shall use\r\n  the name of the  other for commercial, advertising, or promotional\r\n  purposes without specific prior written permission.\r\n\r\n  We suggest,  but do not require, that  you use one or  more of the\r\n  following phrases to refer  to this software in your documentation\r\n  or advertising  materials: `FreeType Project',  `FreeType Engine',\r\n  `FreeType library', or `FreeType Distribution'.\r\n\r\n  As  you have  not signed  this license,  you are  not  required to\r\n  accept  it.   However,  as  the FreeType  Project  is  copyrighted\r\n  material, only  this license, or  another one contracted  with the\r\n  authors, grants you  the right to use, distribute,  and modify it.\r\n  Therefore,  by  using,  distributing,  or modifying  the  FreeType\r\n  Project, you indicate that you understand and accept all the terms\r\n  of this license.\r\n\r\n4.
