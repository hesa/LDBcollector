(You will not be\nrequired to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but only to the computing\ncommunity at large as a market that must bear the fee.)\n\n\"Freely Available\" means that no fee is charged for the item itself, though\nthere may be fees involved in handling the item. It also means that recipients\nof the item may redistribute it under the same conditions they received it.\n\n1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the Standard\nVersion of this Package without restriction, provided that you duplicate all of\nthe original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.\n\n2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived\nfrom the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Package modified in such\na way shall still be considered the Standard Version.\n\n3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided that\nyou insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and when you\nchanged that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the following:\n\na) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them Freely\nAvailable, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or an equivalent\nmedium, or placing the modifications on a major archive site such as ftp.uu.net,\nor by allowing the Copyright Holder to include your modifications in the\nStandard Version of the Package.\n\nb) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.\n\nc) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict with\nstandard executables, which must also be provided, and provide a separate manual\npage for each non-standard executable that clearly documents how it differs from\nthe Standard Version.\n\nd) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.\n\n4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or executable\nform, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:\n\na) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files, together\nwith instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where to get the\nStandard Version.\n\nb) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of the Package\nwith your modifications.\n\nc) accompany any non-standard executables with their corresponding Standard\nVersion executables, giving the non-standard executables non-standard names, and\nclearly documenting the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together\nwith instructions on where to get the Standard Version.\n\nd) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.\n\n5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this Package.\nYou may charge any fee you choose for support of this Package. You may not\ncharge a fee for this Package itself. However, you may distribute this Package\nin aggregate with other (possibly commercial) programs as part of a larger\n(possibly commercial) software distribution provided that you do not advertise\nthis Package as a product of your own.\n\n6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as output from\nthe programs of this Package do not automatically fall under the copyright of\nthis Package, but belong to whomever generated them, and may be sold\ncommercially, and may be aggregated with this Package.\n\n7.
