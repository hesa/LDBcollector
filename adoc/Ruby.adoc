* ``This version of the Ruby license is the latest found in the dual
license COPYING dated from 2010-09-15 Per SPDX.org, Ruby is
disjunctively licensed project that allows the choice of this license
and another. The other license choice has changed over time (from GPL
originally, to BSD-2-Clause currently), so one needs to be aware of that
change. The Ruby License itself is un-versioned, but has varied a bit
over the years, the last substantive variation being in 2002. ''

* ``Lizenzen ohne Copyleft-Effekt zeichnen sich dadurch aus, dass sie
dem Lizenznehmer alle Freiheiten einer Open Source Lizenz einräumen und
für Veränderungen der Software keine Bedingungen hinsichtlich des zu
verwendenden Lizenztyps enthalten. Damit kann der Lizenznehmer
veränderte Versionen der Software unter beliebigen Lizenzbedingungen
weiterverbreiten, also auch in proprietäre Software überführen.''
