=== General Comments

* ``This version of the Ruby license is the latest found in the dual
license COPYING dated from 2010-09-15 Per SPDX.org, Ruby is
disjunctively licensed project that allows the choice of this license
and another. The other license choice has changed over time (from GPL
originally, to BSD-2-Clause currently), so one needs to be aware of that
change. The Ruby License itself is un-versioned, but has varied a bit
over the years, the last substantive variation being in 2002. ''

     you do at least ONE of the following:

       a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise
          make them Freely Available, such as by posting said
