=== General Comments

* ``Per Fedora, there is a certain irony in a Frenchman writing a
license that isn't wholly applicable in France, due to Moral Rights. But
I digress. This license is basically the same as the WTFPL (with
slightly less profanity). It is Free and GPL-Compatible. A copy of the
license text was taken from http://imapsync.lamiral.info/COPYING on
2012-07-09. '' (source:
