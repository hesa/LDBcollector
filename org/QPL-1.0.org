** Comments on (easy) usability

- *↑*"Is OSI Approved" (source:
  [[https://spdx.org/licenses/QPL-1.0.html][SPDX]])

- "The QPL is not GPL-compatible, which, regardless of one's opinion
  about the license's DFSG-freeness, poses a major practical problem for
  any code licensed under the QPL that is reused elsewhere in
  conjunction with code under the GNU GPL. This makes the QPL alone a
  particularly poor choice of license for a library. Furthermore, it is
  not clear that the Trolltech corporation (the author of the Qt library
  and the QPL itself) believes the QPL to be a free software license.
  Trolltech's website describes how their dual-license approach is
  intended to be "open source-friendly" (see
  http://www.trolltech.com/company/model.html). If Trolltech felt that
  the QPL alone were friendly enough to open-source, why do they have a
  dual-licensing policy?" (source:

** General Comments

- "Strong copyleft licenses require you to share both the licensed
  software (like the weak copyleft licenses, and larger programs that
  you build with the licensed software, when you give copies to others."

The recipients must be able to do so without any charges whatsoever, and they must be able to re-distribute to anyone they choose.

      c. If the items are not available to the general public, and the initial developer of the Software requests a copy of the items, then you must supply one.

  Limitations of Liability
  In no event shall the initial developers or copyright holders be liable for any damages whatsoever, including - but not restricted to - lost revenue or profits or other direct, indirect, special, incidental or consequential damages, even if they have been advised of the possibility of such damages, except to the extent invariable law, if any, provides otherwise.
